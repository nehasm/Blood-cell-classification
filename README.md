# Blood-cell-classification
Convolution neural network  model to classify the blood cell.



The respository or the project is build to classify an image type using image input.
The dataset include the images of blood cells,which are of different type.
The model is build using keras api with tensorflow backend including the convolution neural network to recognize the type of cell in the image.
The weights are used in the model to increase the accuracy of model.
After training the training data in neural network,the model is tested using the test data and the accuracy graph is plotted to get the efficiency of model.The dataset used in the repository is available at kaggle.
